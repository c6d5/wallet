                            Your information, including the Personal Data that you provide to us, may be transferred to, stored at and processed by us outside the country in which you reside, including, but not limited to the United States,
                            where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. By providing any information, including Personal Data, on our Site, you consent to such
                            transfer, storage, and processing. We may also transfer Personal Data from the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom to the United States, as needed, to perform the Services that you have requested from
                            us. We will take steps that we believe to be reasonably necessary to treat your Personal Data securely and in accordance with this Policy.

                        <h3>Security</h3>
                        <p>
                            We use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Personal Data within our organization. However, as no electronic transmission or storage of Personal Data can be entirely
                            secure, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your Personal Data. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem
                            by contacting us via the “Contact Information” section below.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Retention</h3>
                        <p>
                            We will only retain your Personal Data as long as reasonably required for us to provide the requested customer support and inquiry services. In the context of customer support, we retain information sufficient to
                            connect subsequent requests from the same user in order to provide efficient service, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example for regulatory purposes).
                        </p>
