                        <h1>WWWallet Terms of Use</h1>
                        <p>
                            Effective Date: Dec 24, 2021 <br />
                            Last Updated Date: May 3, 2022
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please read these terms of use agreement (the “terms”) carefully as they form a binding legal agreement between you and WWWallet movement, inc. (“WWWallet” or “we: and its derivatives). This site and any other
                            sites of WWWallet (collectively, the “site”) and the information on it are controlled by WWWallet. These terms govern the use of the site and apply to all visitors to the site and those who use the blockchain
                            currency management software that is downloadable from the site (the “software”), as well as other services and resources available or enabled via the site, (each a “service” and collectively, the “services”,
                            which term includes the software and the site unless explicitly set forth below).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By clicking on the “i accept” button, completing the registration process, downloading the software and/or browsing the site, you represent that (1) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the terms,
                            (2) you are of legal age to form a binding contract with WWWallet, and (3) you have the authority to enter into the terms personally or on behalf of the legal entity on for whom you are using the services. The
                            term “you” refers to you individually or the legal entity on whose behalf the services are used, as applicable. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms, you may not access or use the services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Section 10 of the terms contains an arbitration agreement which will, with limited exceptions, require disputes between you and WWWallet to be submitted to binding and final arbitration. Unless you opt out of the
                            arbitration agreement: (1) you will only be permitted to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding;
                            and (2) you are waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial on your claims.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            WWWallet may modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we do so, we will change the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms and, as available. By Continuing to use the Site or
                            Services following the release of updated Terms you consent to the updated Terms. We invite you to check this page regularly for updates to these Terms.
                        </p>

                        <h3>1. Use of the Services</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Software, the Site, the Services, and the information and content available therein (“WWWallet Content”) are protected worldwide by copyright laws. Subject to the Terms, WWWallet grants you a limited license
                            to reproduce portions of WWWallet Content solely as required to use the Services for your personal or internal business purposes. Unless otherwise specified by WWWallet in a separate license, your right to use
                            any WWWallet Content is subject to these Terms. WWWallet is not a bank or financial institution and does not provide investment or financial advice or consulting services to users of the Services. We are solely
                            the provider of the Services.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1.1. WWWallet Software</h3>
                        <p>
                            Use of the Software is governed by these Terms. WWWallet delivers the Software via download and WWWallet will not provide you with any tangible copy of the Software. Subject to your compliance with the Terms,
                            WWWallet grants you a nonassignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, and non-exclusive license to use the Software on computers you own or control solely for your personal or internal business
                            purposes. Because the Software is locally installed, you are responsible for the security of the device on which it is installed, including ensuring that you keep anti-virus software current and otherwise protect
                            the device on which the Software is installed against malware. WWWallet is not responsible for any loss or damages – including loss of funds or lockout from accounts accessed via the Software – resulting from
                            your failure to keep the device on which the Software is installed safe and free of any malware. WWWallet cannot recover passwords or unlock account information stored on the Software in any circumstances,
                            including if the Software is compromised by malware on your computer, and it is your sole responsibility to take all reasonable precautions to secure and backup your copy of the Software and the information
                            stored on it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Software and Services are evolving and you may be required to accept or install updates to the Software or Services, or update third-party software (i.e., browsers or OS) in order to keep using the Software
                            or Services or access their latest features, including security updates. We may update the Software and Services at any time, without providing notice.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1.3. Certain Restrictions</h3>
                        <p>
                            By accessing the Services, you agree not to: (a) license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, reproduce, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or WWWallet Content, or any portion

                            or download data from any web pages in the Site (except that we grant operators of public search engines revocable permission to do so for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices (but
                            not caches or archives) of such content; (f) access the Site, Services, or Software in order to build a similar or competitive Site, Services, or Software; (g) copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, download,
                            display, post or transmit any WWWallet Content except as expressly permitted herein; and (h) remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in the Services or WWWallet
                            Content. WWWallet, its suppliers and service providers reserve all rights not granted in the Terms. Any unauthorized use of the Services terminates the licenses granted by WWWallet herein.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1.4. Third-Party API Providers</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Services may incorporate, or may provide access to, applications or materials that are hosted by another party, including (i) crypto assets, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, (ii) cryptocurrency exchanges (for
                            token-to-token exchanges), such as Aeroswap (aeroswap.io), ChangeHero (changehero.io), Changelly (changelly.com), Cripto InterCambio (criptointercambio.com), Fox (fox.exchange), FTX International (ftx.com), FTX
                            US (ftx.us), n.Exchange (n.Exchange), Switchain (switchain.com), and Wyre Payments, Inc. (sendwyre.com), (iii) the lightning network such as Wallet of Satoshi, which requires you to create an account using your
                            WWWallet bitcoin wallet (walletofsatoshi.com) and (iv) other third-party services such as tZERO ATS, LLC, tZERO Markets, LLC, and Electronic Transaction Clearing, Inc., DBA Apex Pro.(collectively, “Third Party
                            Services'').
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You understand and agree that all cryptocurrency exchanges provided through the Services are executed by Third Party Service providers, and that WWWallet does not itself directly exchange virtual currencies.
                            Access to Third Party API Providers may be geo-blocked for residents of certain countries and certain states of the United States. There can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party
                            service providers have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats. While we take steps in an effort to protect the security of our platform and the availability, integrity,
                            confidentiality and security of our data, our security measures or those of our third-party providers could fail and result in unauthorized access to or use of our platform or unauthorized, accidental or unlawful
                            access to, or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of, our or our customers’ data.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Private keys may also be compromised if customers choose to store their private keys in non-secure systems, such as third-party email services, which may be susceptible to security breaches and security
                            incidents, despite our efforts to discourage our customers from engaging in these practices. Although such incidents are outside of our control and do not relate to any insecurity or vulnerability on the part of
                            the WWWallet Platform, customers may nevertheless blame or become dissatisfied with the WWWallet Platform as a result of these negative experiences. Do not share any credential, private key, or other sensitive
                            information with any third party without validating their legitimacy. Third Party API Providers are available to you, subject to the terms and conditions of each third party provider.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To the extent Third Party API Providers have terms that differ from these Terms, you may be required to agree to those terms in order to access their Software, Site, or Services. We do not control the terms,
                            policies, or performance of any third party, and are not responsible for any performance, or failure to perform, of any Third Party Software, Site, or Services, including exchange rates, processing of
                            transactions, and similar activities. We do not provide customer support for transactions performed on third-party API provider’s Software, Site, or Services. When you leave the WWWallet software and access the
                            third-party's software, their Terms of Service govern the transaction
                        </p>

                            the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The

                            has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

                            Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review

                            or user cannot be arbitrated or consolidate with those of any other customer or user. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a) representative action for public injunctive relief may be arbitrated on a
                            class basis and (b) in the event that the foregoing sentence is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular class or dispute for recovery of damages, neither you nor we are entitled to
